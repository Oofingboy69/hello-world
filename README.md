# Hello, World!

Hey :wave:! This is my first ever GitHub repository. I have created this entire GitHub repository using termux and my android tablet :rocket:

## How I did this ?

I have used termux to get the interface and experience of a actually linux terminal. I have used vim to write some code and this `README` file also.
I have installed the `python` and `git` package using the `pkg` package manager in termux and configired my github account.
